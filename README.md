This app will make planning a hunter/jumper course as easy as just dragging and dropping elements.

The user will be able to give the size of the arena to work with.
There will be a sidebar that has different types of jumps to add to a course.
The user will be able to add different colors to the selected jumps and have an option of adding decorations.
A course path, arrows, and comments can be added to the course.
There will be different views of jumps from above and from face on.
Users can then save (as long as they have a user name) or print out the course.

*** Possibly add a run button which will run the course for you?****

*** Possibly add a custom cross-country portion where I pull from the Google maps or Google Earth API.***

For the non-horse person here are some links to what hunter/jumper and cross-country is.
